## Process

**Design process**: I'm using [Figma](http://figma.com/) to design any website or application.
For react App I always consider component composition in designing. It helps me to have a grate knowledge
about the structur of my app.

**Development process**: I usually start the project by learning about the technology that I have less experience with. In this project, I started by reviewing Graphql and React Hydration.
The next step was reading the documentation of the API I'm going to consume in the app [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) and I started to make and test queries for the pages using (https://graphbrainz.herokuapp.com/).
For React Hydration I read many documents and I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it is not complete yet but I made another Branch (SSR-try ) for it so you can see what I've done.
After gathering the information, I started the project by installing all tools I need and tested before.
Since I wanted to do all requirements in the challenge and I did this project in my free time between the work I had to do some tasks out of the order than I usually do.
In the end, I tried to do some unit tests on the project(never do at the end ðŸ˜Š), testing on different browsers and different size devices to be sure it is fully responsive.
